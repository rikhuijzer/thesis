\chapter{Improving accuracy}
\label{ch:improving_accuracy}

The goal is to improve the classification accuracy for natural language understanding, specifically intent classification.
A search is conducted in section~\ref{sec:search} to find ways to improve the accuracy.
BERT is deemed to be the most promising and discussed in section~\ref{sec:bert}.
The section about BERT describes the model and it is implemented for this thesis.
Accuracy scores for BERT are listed in section~\ref{sec:results} and compared to a baseline.
