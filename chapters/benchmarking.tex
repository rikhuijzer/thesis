\chapter{Benchmarking}
\label{ch:benchmarking}

This chapter aims to answer the first research question.
The goal is to create a reproducible benchmark tool, simply called \textsc{bench}.
Datasets used by the benchmark tool are described in section~\ref{sec:datasets}.
The benchmarked systems are described in section~\ref{sec:systems}.
Running the benchmarks on various datasets and systems resulted in scores, see section~\ref{sec:benchmark_results}.
It has been found that \textsc{bench} is impractical, described in section~\ref{sec:issues}.
Notes on using the tool and a high-level overview is presented in appendix~\ref{ch:bench}.
