\chapter{Benchmarking}
\label{ch:benchmarking}

This chapter aims to answer the first research question.
The goal is to create a reproducible benchmark tool, simply called \textsc{bench}.
Datasets used by the benchmark tool are described in Section~\ref{sec:datasets}.
The benchmarked systems are described in Section~\ref{sec:systems}.
\textsc{bench} is described in Section~\ref{sec:bench} as are results obtained by running the benchmarks.
It has been observed that \textsc{bench} needs further requirements to be more useful, these requirements are described in Section~\ref{sec:observations}.
Notes on using the tool are presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:bench}.
