\chapter{Benchmarking}
\label{ch:benchmarking}

This chapter aims to answer the first research question.
The goal is to create a reproducible benchmark tool, simply called \textsc{bench}.
Datasets used by the benchmark tool are described in Section~\ref{sec:datasets}.
The benchmarked systems are described in Section~\ref{sec:systems}.
Running the benchmarks on various datasets and systems resulted in scores, see Section~\ref{subsec:benchmark_results}.
It has been observed that \textsc{bench} has certain requirements to be useful, described in Section~\ref{sec:observations}.
Notes on using the tool and a high-level overview is presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:bench}.
