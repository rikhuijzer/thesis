\chapter{\textsc{improv}}
\label{ch:improv}
% intro
The project aimed to improve accuracy is called \textsc{improv} and available on Github (\url{https://github.com/rikhuijzer/improv}).
One warning for people interested in reading or using this code is that it is in need of refactoring.
The code is cloned from the Google BERT code, built on the Google TensorFlow library, as provided by the researchers~\citep{devlin2018github}.

% pytorch
Alternatively, code is available for the PyTorch library~\citep{wolf2018github}.
The PyTorch implementation is under active development unlike the TensorFlow implementation and includes more functionality.
Features include Multi-GPU, distributed and 16-bits training.
These allow the model to be trained more easily on GPUs by reducing and distributing the memory used by the model.
BERT contains various models including \bert{base} and \bert{large}.
Since Google Colab does not provide a multi-GPU set-up, we need to use a TPU.
This is not yet supported by PyTorch~\citep{wolf2018github}.

\section{Usage}
\label{sec:improv_usage}
The \textsc{improv} code can partially be executed on a local system.
However, training the model requires at least one enterprise grade GPU.
This is discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:training}.
GPUs and TPUs are provided for free by Google Colab~\citep{google2019colab}.
Using this code means importing one of IPython Notebooks from the \textsc{improv} repository in Colab.
Hyperparameters can be set in the Notebook after which the code can be executed.
The Notebook require a Google Account combined with a paid Google Cloud Bucket.
The Bucket is used to store the trained checkpoints created by training the model.
Newer runs listed in the `runs' folder in the Github repository depend on \textsc{improv}, \textsc{nlu\_datasets} and \textsc{rasa\_nlu}.
The dependencies list the used version in the Notebook.
When errors occur make sure that the correct versions are cloned or installed.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:improv_overview}
Since the code is in need of refactoring this section will only describe the most important parts of the project.

\section{TPU and the Estimator API}
\label{sec:tpu_and_api}
Visualisation of the training is supported by TensorFlow's module called TensorBoard.
It allows users to define metrics in the model definition which are used by TensorBoard to generate advanced plots.
The plots contain not only the metrics (for example, accuracy and loss), but also timestamps for each point and sliders to set area to plot.
TensorBoard is included in the default models for TensorFlow and included in the \textsc{Estimator} API.
The \textsc{Estimator} API is a class which can be used to define a model.
One has to create an \textsc{input\_fn} and \textsc{model\_fn} which respectively define data import and the model.
Training is then simply a matter of calling \textsc{estimator.train(input\_fn, ...)}.
Evaluation and prediction are similar.

Unfortunately, this is not supported for TPUs:
``TensorBoard summaries [as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tensorboard}] are a great way to inside your model.
A minimal set of basic summaries are automatically recorded by the \textsc{TPUEstimator}, to \textsc{event} files in the \textsc{model\_dir}.
Custom summaries, however, are currently unsupported when training on a Cloud TPU.''~\citep{google2019tpu}.

Two reasons for not supporting TensorBoard summaries in TPUs are likely.
Firstly, it seems that the TPUs are mainly used for inference~\citep{lakshmanan2018tpu}.
Secondly, the TPUs are a type of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) meaning that TensorBoard summaries are omitted due to technically issues.

\iffalse
The code has used the workaround presented by~\citet{lakshmanan2018tpu}.
The workaround increased running time for the following reason.
For each intermediate result (each point in the plot) the occurring actions are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transfer model checkpoint from TPU to Google Bucket.
    \item Shutdown TPU.
    \item Initialize TPU.
    \item Transfer model checkpoint from Google Bucket to TPU.
    \item Evaluate.
    \item Transfer model checkpoint from TPU to Google Bucket.
    \item Shutdown TPU.
    \item Initialize TPU.
    \item Transfer model checkpoint from Google Bucket to TPU.
\end{enumerate}
The shutdown and initialization takes about 30 seconds.
Transferring data (around 1.2 GB) takes about 10 seconds.
Hence, calculating one intermediate result takes about one and a half minute.
Note that this can not be optimalized by running evaluation on the Google Colab machine (CPU) since it will run out of memory.
(For a local machine with 16 GB RAM evaluation or `inference' on \bert{base} is possible and requires only a few minutes when setting batch size to 16.)
This workaround made the code more complex and execution slower which hindered the experiments.
So, it was decided to stop using the workaround.

\section{Additional experiment}
\label{sec:additional_experiments}
In Section~\ref{sec:results} the intent accuracy score for Snips2017 is near zero for runs using batch size 8 and 32.
During the run on batch size 8 the loss on the test set was 0.07 at step 1000\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rikhuijzer/improv/blob/master/runs/snips2017/2018-12-20 snips intent batch size 8.ipynb}}.
When comparing this to loss scores in other runs this suggests that the accuracy is not near zero.
The loss is in between 1 and 5 for step $2000, 3000, \cdots, 6000$.
This leads to the hypothesis that the model is training too much.
Three runs using the same hyperparameters, but reduced to 1000 steps\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rikhuijzer/improv/tree/master/runs/2019-01-23 snips}} indicate that the hypothesis is false.
It seems that the model found a suitable local minimum by chance.
