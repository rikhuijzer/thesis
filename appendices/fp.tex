\chapter{Notes on functional programming in Python}
\label{ch:fp}

Python is not a pure functional language.
However more and more constructs of functional programming are being added to the language each year.
This appendix will explain some functional ideas used in the code, as presented by~\citet{lott2015}.
Higher-order functions take or return functions, this is used to replace the factory design pattern as explained in Section~\ref{sec:mapping_to_functions}.
Keeping track of state without a class results in function signatures to contain many parameters, these can be handled by using NamedTuples, see Section~\ref{sec:named_tuple}.
Another benefit of classes is that data can be stored, used for example in caching.
A convenient solution for caching is described in Section~\ref{sec:function_caching}.
Collections of data are typically transformed via loops.
Here each loop will transform the entire collection and move to the next transformation.
Lazy evaluation, as described in Section~\ref{sec:lazy_evaluation}, uses a more efficient way.

\section{Mapping to functions}
\label{sec:mapping_to_functions}
In code we often have a function which calls other functions depending on some conditionals.
For example in `system.py` the factory design pattern is replaced by a more functional design.
In this design `system.py` behaves like a super and delegates the work based on what system
we currently interested in.
We give an example for two systems.
The delegation could be done via conditional statements.

\begin{verbatim}
    if 'mock' in system.name:
      response = src.systems.mock.get_response(tp.Query(system, message.text))
    elif 'rasa' in system.name:
      response = src.systems.rasa.get_response(tp.Query(system, message.text))
    elif ...
\end{verbatim}

This introduces a lot of code duplication.
Therefore a dict is created.
\begin{verbatim}
    get_intent_systems = {
      'mock': src.systems.mock.get_response,
      'rasa': src.systems.rasa.get_response,
      ...
    }
\end{verbatim}
Now we can just get the correct function from the dict and call it.
\begin{verbatim}
    func: Callable[[tp.Query], tp.Response] =
      get_substring_match(get_intent_systems, system.name)
    query = tp.Query(system, message.text)
    response = func(query)
\end{verbatim}

Note that \textsc{get\_substring\_match()} implements the substring matching used in the conditional code (\textsc{if 'mock' in system.name:}).
Since the code can return any of the functions contained in the mapping they should all have the same signature and output.
The used IDE (PyCharm 2018.2.4) is not able to check this.
Therefore, functions from the mapping \textsc{func} get a type hint.
This allows the IDE to check types again and it allows developers to see what signature should be used for all the functions in the mapping.

\section{NamedTuple}
\label{sec:named_tuple}
Pure functions by definition cannot rely on information stored somewhere in the system.
We provide one example from the code where this created a problem and how this can be solved using NamedTuples.

The benchmarking tools communicates with a system called Rasa.
Rasa starts in a default, untrained, state.
To measure its performance we train Rasa and then send many sentences to the system.
In general one prefers to functions should be as generic as possible.
It makes sense to have one function which takes some sentence, sends it to Rasa to be classified and returns all information from the response.
To avoid re-training Rasa for each system we have to remember whether Rasa is already trained.
Passing a flag 'retrain' to the system is insufficient, since the function does not know where Rasa should train on.
To make it all work we need the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textsc{sentence}: The sentence text.
    \item \textsc{sentence\_corpus}: The corpus the sentence is taken from.
    \item \textsc{system\_name}: Used to call the function which can train the specific system we are interested in.
    \item \textsc{system\_knowledge}: Used in combination with \textsc{sentence\_corpus} to determine whether we need to re-train.
    \item \textsc{system\_data}: In specific cases even more information is needed.
\end{itemize}
re-training the system to check whether its outputs differ.

When this function has decided to train the system the system\_knowledge changes.
% todo: what should be on next line
So as output we need to return ``

Since Python 3.5 a NamedTuple with type hints is available.

To allow for better type checking and reduce the number of function parameters use is made of \textsc{typing.NamedTuples}.

% todo: Explain how NamedTuples help type checking on Factory Design pattern replacement.

\section{Function caching}
\label{sec:function_caching}
Functions can be cached using \textsc{functools.lru\_cache}.
This is mainly used for reducing the number of filesystem operations.
A typical example is as follows.
Suppose we write some text to a file iteratively by calling \textsc{write} multiple times.
Since we try to avoid storing a state \textsc{write} does not know whether the file already exists.
To solve we can do two things.
The first option is passing parameters telling the function whether the file already exists.
This is cumbersome, since this state needs to be passed through all the functions to the function which is calling the loop over \textsc{write}.
This can be done directly by calling \textsc{write} or indirectly by calling some other function.
The second option is defining a function to create a file if it does not yet exists \textsc{create\_file}.
We call this function every time \textsc{write} is called.
This does mean that the filesystem is accessed to check the folder each time \textsc{write} is called.
To avoid all those filesystem operations \textsc{create\_file} can be decorated using \textsc{functools.lru\_cache}.
Now on all but the first calls to \textsc{create\_file} just query memory.

% caveats
There is one caveat with this using function caching.
Make sure to not try to mimic state.
In other words the program should not change behaviour if the cache is removed.
Reason for this is that any state introduced via the cache is similar to creating functions with side-effects but without all the constructs from object-oriented programming.

\section{Lazy evaluation}
\label{sec:lazy_evaluation}
By default Python is not interested in performance and advises to use a list for every collection.
However, lists are mutable and therefore not suitable for hashing.
Since hashing is not possible any function taking lists as input is not suitable for function caching.

Also, in many cases the list might not be the final structure we need.
Consider the following use cases where the output of type list is used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only unique values are required, so the list is casted to a set.
    \item Only whether some value satisfies P is required.
    \item The x first elements are required.
    \item Only the values satisfying x are required.
    \item Only an output which is transformed is required.
\end{itemize}

Considering all these use cases it makes more sense to return an iterator by default instead of a collection.
One practical example for the bench project which supports this notion is using an iterator on classification requests.

Suppose we want to measure the performance of some cloud service.
Suppose we wrote some code which takes a sentence from some corpus and performs the following operations on this sentence:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Send the sentence to some cloud service.
    \item Transforms the response to the pieces of information we need.
    \item Store this information.
\end{enumerate}
Suppose one of the last two operations contains a mistake causing the program to crash.
When not using an iterator all sentences will have been sent to the cloud service after the first operation.
Since the post-processing did not succeed we did not obtain results and need to redo this operation.
In effect the programming error caused us to waste about as many API calls as there are sentences in the corpus we are testing.
This is a problem since the API calls cost money and take time to execute.

To solve this use lazy evaluation.
For example, functions supporting lazy evaluation in Python are \textsc{map}, \textsc{filter}, \textsc{reduce} and \textsc{any}.
Another benefit for using iterators is that it improves modularity and, once used to the paradigm, readability.
Take the following typical Python code.

\begin{verbatim}
    my_list = []
    for item in some_iterable:
      updated_item = g(f(item))
      my_list.append(updated_item)
\end{verbatim}

In this code some iterable is read and the transformation \textsc{f} and \textsc{g} are applied to each item in the iterable.
The same code can be rewritten to use \textsc{map} as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
    def transform(item: SomeType) -> OtherType:
      return g(f(item))

    my_iterable = map(transform, some_iterable)
\end{verbatim}
